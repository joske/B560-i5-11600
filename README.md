# B560-i5-11600

OpenCore config for my Rocket Lake desktop containing:

* ASUS prime B560-PLUS 
* i5 11600 + be quiet! Shadow Rock 3 cooler
* be quiet! Pure Power 11 500W
* AMD Radeon rx 460
* Samsung 980 pro NVMe drive (Linux)
* Samsung 850 EVO 500 GB (GhostBSD)
* Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB (macOS)
* Kingston 128 GB (win 10)
* 32 GB corsair DDR4-3200 RAM
* ASUS DRW-24D5MT
* be quiet! PURE BASE 600 case

Working:
* the machine boots, and show both displays
* accelerated graphics with native AMD driver (with the rx460 - rocket lake iGPU not supported)
* external sound works with alcid 69 (USB audio, HDMI/DP audio). Sees the internal audio device, but does not seem to output any sound and all apps using sound with that device selected are getting stuck
* on board ethernet (intel) works
* all USB ports work
* appletv+ playback with shikigva=128
* sleep/resume with following pmset options:
```
âžœ  ~ sudo pmset -g

Quirk:
* DVD player clicks every 7 minutes or so - seems to be known issue

What doesn't work:
* audio out of internal jack - does not matter, using USB audio directly to my Kanto TUK speakers
