# B560-i5-11600

OpenCore config for my Rocket Lake desktop containing:

- ASUS prime B560-PLUS
- i5 11600 + be quiet! Shadow Rock 3 cooler
- be quiet! Pure Power 11 500W
- AMD Radeon rx 460
- Samsung 980 pro M.2 NVMe drive (Arch Linux)
- Samsung 850 EVO SATA 500 GB (GhostBSD + Ubuntu)
- Samsung 850 EVO SATA 250 GB (macOS Ventura)
- Kingston SATA 128 GB (win 10)
- 32 GB corsair DDR4-3200 RAM
- ASUS DRW-24D5MT
- be quiet! PURE BASE 600 case

Working:

- the machine boots, and show both displays
- accelerated graphics with native AMD driver (with the rx460 - rocket lake iGPU not supported)
- sound works with alcid 11 (jack, USB audio, HDMI/DP audio). Since AppleALC 1.6.8, internal audio works!
- on board ethernet (intel) works
- all USB ports work
- appletv+ playback with shikigva=128
- sleep/resume with following pmset options:

```
âžœ  ~ sudo pmset -g

```

Quirk:

- ~~DVD player clicks every 7 minutes or so - seems to be known issue~~ Fixed by setting disksleep to 0

What doesn't work:
nothing (well, I don't know about apple services like handover and stuff as I don't use those. I guess it works).
